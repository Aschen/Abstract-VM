# Abstract-VM

Epitech project : We have to create a VM that can interpret and execute assembly-like files which are arithmetic expressions.

## How to
* Compile : make
* Run : ./avm --help

## Feature
* Commands : push pop dump assert add sub mul div mod print exit
* Numeric values : int8 int16 int32 float double
* The AVM is like a stack, you can push or pop value on the stack and then execute arithmetic operation like add or mul.
